## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 tablespoon butter
- [ ] 1 medium yellow onion chopped
- [ ] 3 large white potatoes cubed, about 4 cups
- [ ] 4 cups chicken broth
- [ ] 4-6 cups broccoli florets
- [ ] 3 cups whole milk
- [ ] 3 cups shredded medium cheddar cheese
- [ ] 2 tablespoons flour
- [ ] ½ teaspoon kosher salt (or to taste)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (or to taste)

## Instructions

- Melt the butter in a large dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and cook
  for 4-5 minutes, until softened, stirring occasionally. Add the cubed
  potatoes, chicken broth and the kosher salt and bring to a boil, then reduce
  the heat to a rolling simmer and cook the potatoes for about 8 minutes or
  until soft and easily pierced with a fork. Whiz the potatoes and broth with an
  immersion blender to the consistency you desire (I like to leave some chunks
  of potato), or mash with a potato masher. Add the broccoli florets and the
  milk and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cooking for 5-7 minutes or
  until the broccoli is al denté.
- Toss the cheese with the flour and add to the soup 1 cup at a time, stirring
  until melted before adding the next batch of cheese. Season with black pepper
  and more salt to taste.
